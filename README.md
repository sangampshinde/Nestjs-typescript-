# NEST JS
NestJS is a framework for building server-side applications using Node.js, built on top of Express.js (or optionally Fastify) and heavily inspired by Angular’s architecture — it uses modules, controllers, providers (services), and dependency injection to create highly testable, structured, and reusable code.
